    <h1>The Little Mermaid</h1>
    
    <p id="parah1"> A little mermaid used to live in the ocean of Atlantica. She desired to be human, and when she found herself saving a handsome prince from suffocation, she came to the conclusion that she must become human at any cost because she must go with him.


        This inspired her to go see an ocean witch, who demanded that she give up her voice in exchange for human legs, with the condition that she would return to the sea as a slave if the prince didn't wed her.
        
        
        The mermaid then proceeded to see her prince but faced a series of obstacles, starting with the ruler not recognising her and ending with several admirers approaching to marry him. The mermaid and ruler finally reunite, defeating the witch and going on to live happily ever after.</p>

    <h1>A Short Story on King Cobra and Ant</h1>
    <br>
    <p id="parah2">Once upon a time, there lived a huge King Cobra in a dense forest. When he was small, he liked to eat small creatures. But, when he grew up, he started eating lizards, eggs, frogs, and rabbits. Further, when he grew up more,  he even started eating small snakes. 


        As he began to grow more and more, his pride began to grow with him. All the other animals in the forest also began to fear the King Cobra. This also boosted King Cobra’s pride each day.
        
        
        Soon, the King Cobra began to think he was the most powerful creature  and the king of  the forest as all other animals in the forest feared him. Being the most powerful creature and king of the forest, he thought that he should now move from his small hole to a bigger and more decent place. So, he started searching for a place that would suit his size and status.
        
        
        After some time, he finally came across a big tree. He selected the tree as his house. But suddenly, he observed an anthill near the tree.  He thought, “Why should there be an ugly ant hill near my big house?”
        
        
        Seeing the anthill near his royal house, he started shouting with full force “I am King Cobra, the most powerful creature and king of the forest”. He ordered the ants to leave the place immediately. There was no reply from the ants’ side. This made him angry. So, he got wild and struck the ant’s hill.
        
        
        Strangely, within minutes, thousands of ants swarmed up the King Cobra biting him everywhere. King Cobra struggled hard for some time and at last, died a painful death.
        
        
        Moral of the Story the King Cobra and Ants
        
        The moral of the story is that “We should not be proud of anything as pride goes before fall.” The story also teaches that sometimes even the strong and powerful cannot face the smaller ones when they are large in number. Hence, we should never underestimate the power of any individual.
